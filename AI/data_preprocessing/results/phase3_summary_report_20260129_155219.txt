PHASE 3: FEATURE ENGINEERING SUMMARY
=============================================

Dataset Summary:
- Files Processed: 8
- Original Features: 632
- Final Features: 648
- New Features Created: 16
- Feature Reduction: -2.53%

Engineering Summary:
- Average Features per File: 81.0
- Feature Optimization: Moderate
- Scaling Method: MinMaxScaler (0-1) for autoencoder compatibility
- Feature Diversity: Mix of flow, statistical, timing, and engineered features

Recommendations:
1. Consider additional feature selection for better performance
2. Reasonable feature count - should perform well
3. Features are scaled and ready for Phase 4: Label Processing
