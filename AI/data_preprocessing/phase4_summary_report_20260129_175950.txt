PHASE 4: LABEL PROCESSING SUMMARY
========================================

Dataset Summary:
- Files Processed: 8
- Total Samples: 1,622,672
- Normal Samples: 1,174,675
- Anomaly Samples: 447,997
- Overall Anomaly Rate: 27.61%

Processing Summary:
- Label Conversion: Multi-class to Binary (Normal vs Anomaly)
- Attack Categories: 27
- Binary Mapping: {'Normal': 0, 'Anomaly': 1}
- Common Balance Status: Severely Imbalanced

Quality Assessment:
- Ready for ML: Yes
- Binary Classification Ready: Yes
- Anomaly Detection Ready: Yes
- Class Balance Attention Needed: Yes

Recommendations:
1. Consider class balancing techniques (SMOTE, undersampling)
2. Very low anomaly rate - consider anomaly detection specific techniques
3. High anomaly rate - verify data quality and labeling
